* Description
Mark V. Shaney was a synthetic Usenet user in the 1980s (see:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_V._Shaney). This program demostrate the use
of Markov Chain to generate random English words as explained by Rob Pike (see:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike) and Brian Kernighan (see:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan) in the book The Practice of
Programming (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Practice_of_Programming)

* The Markov Chain Algorithm:
If we imagine the input as a sequence of overlapping phrases, the algorithm
divides each phrase into two parts, a multi-word prefix and a single suffix word
that follows the prefix. A Markov chain algorithm emits output phrases by
randomly choosing the suffix that follows the prefix, according to the
statistics of (in our case) the original text. Three-word phrases work well - a
two-word prefix is used to select the suffix word:
  1. set W1 and W2 to the first two words in the text

  2. print W1 and W2

  3. loop:

    3.1. randomly choose W3, one of the successors of prefix W1-W2 in the text

    3.2. print W3

    3.3. replace W1 and W2 by W2 and W3

    3.4. repeat loop

* Example run
#+begin_src shell
make release
cat build/release/src/data/text1.txt | build/release/src/random_english

# Output:
One thing was certain, that the _white_ kitten had been hurt by the side of her
noisy little daughter. The Queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through
the air by an invisible hand, and being dusted: he was so covered with ashes.
She said afterwards that she nearly let him drop upon the table near the Queen.
The King immediately fell flat on his back, and lay perfectly still: and Alice
was through the glass, and then they hold up one finger. “I’m going to tell you
all my ideas about Looking-glass House. How would you like to live in
Looking-glass House, if you leave the door of our drawing-room wide open: and
it’s very like our books, only the words go the other way. I can see all of it
when I said ‘Check!’ you purred! Well, it _was_ a nice check, Kitty, and you’ve
not been punished for any of them yet. You know I’m saving up all your faults.
Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing your face this morning.
Now you can’t deny it, Kitty: I heard you! What’s that you say?” (pretending
that the _white_ kitten had had nothing to do
